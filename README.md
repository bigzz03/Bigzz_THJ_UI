This is my custom UI that I have imported over from official servers.  I have been building on this UI for roughly 8 years.  The original creator of it is danielritchie on EQinterface.com under the "Eternal Darkness" UI, however I have made a lot of custom changes to this over the years.

UPDATE 1-19-2025

Added optional windows folder to the UI.  Items in the optional windows folder have had their size increased for those that don't like the tiny size of several windows.  Items increased in size are:

The AA Window has been modified a bit.  Increased some of the font and spread out the layout to make things a bit easier to see.
Large containers.  Increased the size of the containers.  Not quite the size of default, but bigger than what I typically use.

Additionally, I've reverted back to the standard map look.  I have included the option to go to darkmode maps.  In order for the darkmode maps to work, you will need to take the folder called "darkmode" into your maps folder.  Then the cart.tga and EQUI_MapViewWnd.xml files into the main Bigzz_THJ_UI folder.  when in game, you can select the map drop down and select "darkmode".  You can then click the little pliers icon and set different colors for you and your group.

**NOTE** in order to use any item in the optional folder, you will want to change the name of the Bigzz_THJ_UI folder itself.  If you do not change the name of the folder, every time you patch on the launcher, those optional files will be overwritten.

This file contains the following XML files.  If you are looking for a specific file in this UI and do not see, then it is pulling from the default file in the default UI folder.
